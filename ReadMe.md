Features that I added.

1. I added a feature that will make it easier for the user to see how many tiles
are left in their pouch.

2. The game will automatically end when the player runs out of tiles in the pouch

3. The game has to ability to restart.


Problems:

Everything works except actual words being recognized.
Another problem is that letters can be placed apart.
Sometimes all the tiles wont load properly so just make
sure to reset the game once or twice. Also sometimes it
doesn't give all the tiles so make sure you press continue
another time to give back all the tiles.
